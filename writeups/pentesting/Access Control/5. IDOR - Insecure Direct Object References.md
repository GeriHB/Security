Is a type of access control vulnerability when an app uses user-supplied input to access objects directly. 

IDOR vulnerabilities are most commonly associated with horizontal privilege escalation, however they can also arise in relation to vertical privilege escalation.

For example, a website uses the following URL to access the account page:

`https://insecure-website.com/customer_account?customer_number=132355`

In this example, the customer number is used as a record index in queries that are performed on the database. If no controls are in place, an attacker can simply modify this value, and bypasses access controls.

IDOR vulnerabilities also arise when sensitive resources are located in static files on the server-side filesystem. An example can be a website that saves chat message transcripts using an incrementing filename, like below:

`https://insecure-website.com/static/12144.txt`

So, an attacker can simply modify the filename and retrieves other transcripts.

## Lab.1 - Insecure Direct Object References

Chat logs are stored directly on the server's file system, and are retrieved using static URLs. Find the password for `carlos` and login to their account.

In the lab page, there is a `Live Chat`, and in that page, there is a button `View transcript`.

In Burp I see the URL is `/download-transcript/4.txt`, when I browse through those documents, exactly on the `1.txt` I see chatting about the password.

I use that password to login with the username `carlos`, and the lab is solved.
