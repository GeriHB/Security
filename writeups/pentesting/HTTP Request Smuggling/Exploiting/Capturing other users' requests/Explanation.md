The ability of some applications to store and retrieve textual data (comments, profiles, or emails) can be exploited to capture sensitive data from other users' requests.

This attack involves smuggling a POST request which contains a data store parameter (e.g., comments) placed at the end of the request, combined with a longer Content-Length header.

## Executing the Attack

1. Setup the Smuggled Request:
	- Create a POST request that stores textual data
	- Position the parameter to store at the end of the body
	- Use a longer Content-Length header that exceeds the body size.
2. Trigger the Vulnerability:
	- Backend interprets the incorrect Content-Length, waits for additional data.
	- When another user's request is sent down the same connection, the first bytes are appended to the smuggle request.
3. Exfiltrate the Data:
	- Appended data is stored in the app (blog comment) and can later be retrieved by the attacker.
4. Iterative Refinement:
	- Adjust Content-Length to capture more data.
	- Trial and error may instead of timeouts caused by mismatched lengths.

5. Limitations:
	- Data capture ends at parameter delimiters like & in URL-encoded forms.
