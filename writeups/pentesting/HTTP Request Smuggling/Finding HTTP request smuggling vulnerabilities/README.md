There are different methods finding HTTP request smuggling vulnerabilities. One of the methods is timing techniques.

This main idea here is to check if it is TE.CL or CL.TE vulnerability, by crafting the http request in a way that by causing a time delay shows if it is vulnerable and which vulnerability is.

Another technique is using differential responses.

This involves sending two requests to the application in quick succession: An "attack" request which is designed to interfere with the processing of the next request which is a "normal" request.

If the response to the normal one contains the expected interference, then it is confirmed that the vulnerability exists.

In this section, confirming vulnerabilities using differential responses will be discussed in more detail, by solving PortSwigger labs.
