## 1. What is HTTP Request Smuggling

It is a technique to interfere with the way a website processes sequences of HTTP requests.

Web apps quite frequently employ chains of HTTP servers between users and the app. So when users send requests to a frontend server (load balancer or reverse proxy) and this server forwards then the requests to one or more backend servers.

This behavior is very common in cloud-based apps.

When frontend forwards HTTP requests to the backed, it sends several requests over the same backend network connection, because this is much more efficient, and i this situation it is crucial that both front and backend agree about boundaries between requests.

Here the attacker can intervene and cause part of their frontend request to be interpreted by the backend as the start of the next request, and it is effectively prepended to the next request and can interfere with the way the app processes that request.

## 2. Severity

These vulnerabilities are often critical as they can result in an attacker to bypass security controls, gain unauthorized access to sensitive data, and compromise other app users.

## 3. Content

In this repository, there will be a number of write-ups showing how these attacks are performed and their impact.

The write-ups are from challenges offered on www.portswigger.com and are implemented using the [Burp Suite](https://portswigger.net/burp).
