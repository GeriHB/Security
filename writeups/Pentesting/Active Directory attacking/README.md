# Active Directory Offensive Security

Welcome to the Active Directory Attacking section of my pentesting writeups. 

Here, you'll find detailed guides, methodologies, and tools that I've used for performing attacks on Active Directory (AD) environments. 

This directory is dedicated to sharing knowledge, techniques, and experiences related to Active Directory security testing. 
## GOAD Environment with LUDEUS

**[GOAD (Greedy Offensive Active Directory)](https://github.com/Orange-Cyberdefense/GOAD)** is a lab environment specifically designed for practicing Active Directory attacks. Here's what you can find:

- By now there are writeups on attacking Active Directory using Game of Active Directory (GOAD) which is installed on Ludus.
  - [**LUDUS Tool:**](https://docs.ludus.cloud/docs/intro/)

## Disclaimer

Please note:

- **Use at your own risk**: These techniques are for educational purposes in a controlled environment. Unauthorized penetration testing or hacking can be illegal.
- **Ethical Use**: Always ensure you have explicit permission to test systems you do not own.
