Welcome to the Active Directory Attacking section of my pentesting writeups. 

Here, you'll find detailed guides, methodologies, and tools that I've used for performing attacks on Active Directory (AD) environments. 

This directory is dedicated to sharing knowledge, techniques, and experiences related to Active Directory security testing. 
### GOAD Environment with LUDEUS
