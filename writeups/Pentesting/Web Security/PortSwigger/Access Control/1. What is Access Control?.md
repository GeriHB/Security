Access control are the constraints on who or what is authorized to access recources or perform actions.

- Authentication: confirms the user.
- Session Management: identifies which http requests are made by that same user.
- Access control: determines if the user is allowed to carry out the action.

Access control design decisions are made by humans so the potential for errors is quite high.

## Vertical Access Controls

Different types of users have access to different functions. An administrator can modify or delete any user's account, but this option is not available to an ordinary users.

## Horizontal Access Controls

Different users have access to a subset of resources of the same type. For example in a banking app, a user can be allowed to view transactions and do payments from their accounts, but not other accounts.

## Context-Dependent Access Controls

Restrict access to functionality and resources based on the state of the app or the user's interaction with it. They prevent a user performing actions in the wrong order, for example a retail website might prevent users from editing their shopping cart after the payment has been made.
