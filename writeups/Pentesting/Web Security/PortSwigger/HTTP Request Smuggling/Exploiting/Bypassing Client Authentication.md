Servers authenticate themselves with the client (usually a browser) by providing a certificate, as part of the TLS handshake.

The certificate contains the CN (Common Name) that matches their registered hostname, and then the client uses this to verify that they are talking to a legitimate server that belongs to the expected domain.

Another level of security is that sometimes sites implement a form of mutual TLS authentication, meaning that clients must also present a certificate to the server, and the client's CN is often a username, which can be used in the backend as part of an access control mechanism.

This is done via one or more non-standard HTTP headers, and sometimes the frontend appends a header containing the client's CN to any incoming requests:

```http
GET /admin HTTP/1.1 
Host: normal-website.com 
X-SSL-CLIENT-CN: carlos`
```

These headers are supposed to be hidden from the users, so they are implicitly often trusted by the backend. 

If you are able to send the right combination of headers and values, this enables yiou to bypass access controls.

Smuggling comes into use as in practice frontend tend to overwrite these headers if they're already present, so since smuggling requests are hidden from the frontend, any headers they contain will be sent unchanged to the backend.

```http
POST /example HTTP/1.1
Host: vulnerable-website.com
Content-Type: x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 64
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

0

GET /admin HTTP/1.1
X-SSL-CLIENT-CN: administrator
Foo: x
```
