Websites are exposed to anyone who is connected to internet, and this makes robust authentication mechanisms integral to effective web security.

Three main types of authentication:
- Something you know - "Knowledge factors" - such as passwords
- Something you have - "Possession factors" - such as mobile phone or security token
- Something you are or do - "Inherence factors" - such as biometrics or patterns of behavior

**Authentication vs Authorization**
Authentication is the profess of verifying that the user is the one who claims to be. 

Authorization involves whether a user is allowed to do something.

Most authentication vulnerabilities arise because of:
- Authentication mechanisms are weak.
- Logic flaws or poor coding in the implementation. "Broken authentication".
