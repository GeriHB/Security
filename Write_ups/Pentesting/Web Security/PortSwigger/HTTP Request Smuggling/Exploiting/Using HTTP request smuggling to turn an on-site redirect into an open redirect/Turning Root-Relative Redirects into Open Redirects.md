There are cases of server-level redirects. This means that it uses the path to construct a root-relative URL for the Location:

```http
GET /example HTTP/1.1
Host: normal-website.com

HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
Location: /example/
```

This can still be exploited if the server allows the use of protocol-relative URLs:

```http
GET //attacker-website.com/example HTTP/1.1
Host: vulnerable-website.com

HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
Location: //attacker-website.com/example/
```
