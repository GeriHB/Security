# Penetration Testing

Welcome to the Pentesting section of the write-ups.

Here you'll find most of the write-ups done, and tools used to perform them.

This directory is dedicated into sharing knowledge and techniques on performing the penetration testing on various aspects.

## Structure of the directory

**Pentesting** directory is separated on various sections:

- **Active Directory attacking**, 
- **Web Security**, 
- **HackTheBox**

On **Active Directory attacking** there is a whole process of attacking the **GOAD v3** (Game of Active Directory).

**Web Security** includes a number of topics from the **PortSwigger Academy** and solutions to the labs for these topics.

**HackTheBox** as the name suggests has the most important information from modules and paths from the **HackTheBox Academy**.

All of these directories are being constantly updated, into adding more modules, information, and techniques.

## Disclaimer

Please note:

- **Use at your own risk**: These techniques are for educational purposes in a controlled environment. Unauthorized penetration testing or hacking can be illegal.
- **Ethical Use**: Always ensure you have explicit permission to test systems you do not own.
