It's relatively simple. You should look at all data being passed into the website and try to identify anything that looks serialized.

They can be identified easily if you know the format that different languages use.

## PHP serialization format

Uses a mostly human-readable string format with letters representing the data type, and numbers - length of each entry.

```php
$user->name = "carlos";
$user->isLoggedIn = true;
```

When serialized:

```json
O:4:"User":2:{s:4:"name":s:6:"carlos"; s:10:"isLoggedIn":b:1;}
```

The meaning:
`O:4:"User"` - An object with the 4 character class name `"User`.
`2` - the object has 2 attributes.
`s:4:"name"` - The key of the first attribute is the 4-character string `"name"`.
`s:6:"carlos"` - The value of the first attribute is the 6-character string `"carlos"`.
`s:10:"isLoggedIn"` - The key of the second attribute is 10-character string `"isLoggedIn"`.
`b:1` - The value of the second attribute is the boolean value `true`.

Methods for PHP serialization are:
- serialize()
- unserialize()

## Java serialization format

Uses binary serialization formats. Meaning it's more difficult to read.

Serialized Java objects always begin with the same bytes, which are encoded as `ac ed ` in hexadecimal and `r00` in Base64.

Any class implementing the interface `java.io.Serializable` can be serialized and deserialized, and if you got access to the source code, look out for `readObject()` method that is used to read and deserialize data from an `InputStream`.
