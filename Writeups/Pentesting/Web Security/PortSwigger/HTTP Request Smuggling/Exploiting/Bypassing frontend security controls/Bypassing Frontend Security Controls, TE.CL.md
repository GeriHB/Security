There are many apps that frontend server add some additional headers before they are forwarded to the backend server.

An example would be:
- Terminating the TLS connection and adding headers that describe the protocol and ciphers that were used.
- Adding an "X-Forwarded-For" header which contains the user's IP address.
- Determining the user's ID based on their session token and adding a header which identifies the user.
- Adding some sensitive information which is of interest for other attacks.

This can be useful because sometimes in smuggled requests some headers are missing, and those are normally added by the frontend. In this way backend might not process the requests in the normal way and the smuggled requests will fail to have the effects.

A way to reveal how the frontend rewrites requests can be:
- Find a POST that reflects the value of a request parameter into the app's response.
- Shuffle the parameters so the reflected parameter appears last in the body.
- Smuggle this request to the backend, followed by a normal request whoe rewritten form you want to reveal.
