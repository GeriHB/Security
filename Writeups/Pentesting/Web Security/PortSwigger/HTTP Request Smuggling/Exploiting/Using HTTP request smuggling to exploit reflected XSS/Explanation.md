If an app is vulnerable to smuggling but also has reflected XSS, this can kind of level up the XSS into a superior XSS.

- It requires no interaction with victims. You don't need to feed them an URL and wait for them to visit, just smuggle a request containing the XSS payload and the next user's request that is processed by the backend will be hit.
- It can be used to exploit XSS in parts of the request that can't be trivially controlled in a normal reflected XSS, such as HTTP request headers.

Let's just say that an app has reflected XSS in the User-Agent header. This can be exploited in a request smuggling attack as follows:

```http
POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: vulnerable-website.com
Content-Length: 63
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

0

GET / HTTP/1.1
User-Agent: <script>alert(1)</script>
Foo: X
```

So the next user's request will be appended to the smuggled request, and they will receive the reflected XSS payload in the response.
