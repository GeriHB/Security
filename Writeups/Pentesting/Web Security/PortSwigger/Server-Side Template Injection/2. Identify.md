The next step after `Detecting` is to `Identify` the template engine.

Many of the use very similar syntax, chosen not to clash with HTML, and it can be relatively simple to create probing payloads to test which template engine is being used.

Just submit invalid syntax, and that is often enough as the error message will tell what template engine it is.

For example the invalid expression `<%=foobar%>` triggers this response from the Ruby-based ERB engine:

```sh
(erb):1:in `<main>': undefined local variable or method `foobar' for main:Object (NameError)
from /usr/lib/ruby/2.5.0/erb.rb:876:in `eval'
from /usr/lib/ruby/2.5.0/erb.rb:876:in `result'
from -e:4:in `<main>'
```

But it should be taken into consideration that the same payload sometimes returns a successful response in more than one template language:

`{{7*'7'}}` returns `49` in `Twig` and `7777777` in `Jinja2`.
