# Common Defences

The most common defenses are:
- **CSRF tokens** - A unique, secret, unpredicted value generated by the server-side and shared with the client. The client must include the corrent token in the request, which makes it difficult to construct a valid request on behalf of the victim.
- **SameSite cookies** - A browser security mechanism which determines when a website's cookies are included in requests originating from other websites. It may prevent an attacker from triggering these actions cross-site.
- **Referer-based validation** - Some apps use the HTTP Referer header by verifying that the request originated from the own domain. Less effective than CSRF token validation
