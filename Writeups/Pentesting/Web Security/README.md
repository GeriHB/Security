# Web Security

In this section you'll find write-ups, information, and tools about various aspects of Web attacking.

Beside write-ups, there will be a lot of information regarding the topics, needed not only to perform attacks but also to understand how some of the most common web technologies work.

By now, the information and the labs done are from the **PortSwigger Academy** but will populated with other modules soon.
